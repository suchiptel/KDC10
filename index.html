<h1>Pure Devotion</h1>
<p>Devotional songs were performed at all these village mandirs, especially on the days of Ekadashi, Punam or other festivals. In addition to this, special session of bhajans were also arranged with great fervour and enthusiasm. Each mandir had their own bhajan groups which would sing and perform while standing. Some groups would also be dominated by kartal or kansijodia. Participating in such bhajans would give Shantilal much joy, a little like an avid runner discovering a downward slope. Such was his enthusiasm that these bhajans would often continue until 12 midnight, sometimes even 2am. Simultaneously, Shantilal would sway from one side to the other or wander while singing the bhajans. Occasionally, he would even play the mrudang or tablas. In his own words, he would refer to the rhythm as “dhab-dhab”.
